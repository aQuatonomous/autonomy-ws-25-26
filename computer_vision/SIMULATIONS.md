# Simulations

## Running the sim

```bash
sg simulation
./simulation.bash
```

## RViz2 (point cloud)

Set the transform frame to:

```
blueboat/lidar_link/lidar
```

## RAM

The sim uses a lot of RAM. Run only one instance at a time. If it runs out of memory, try closing VSCode/Cursor or other heavy applications.
