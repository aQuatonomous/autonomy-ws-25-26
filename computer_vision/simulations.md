okay you guys should all have access to the sim
6:12
to run it do:
6:12
sg simulation
6:12
./simulation.bash
6:13
if you want to see the point cloud in rviz2 you need to set the transform frame to blueboat/lidar_link/lidar
6:13
that should be it
6:13
it uses a lot of ram
6:13
so only one person at a time
6:13
it seems like people's vscode and cursor servers are lowkey using a lot of ram so you might have to kill those if sim is running out of ram
