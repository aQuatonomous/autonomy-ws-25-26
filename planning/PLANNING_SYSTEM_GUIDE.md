## System Architecture Overview

The planning system is a **two-layer architecture**:

- **Global Planner**: High-level task logic that determines *where* to go (goals/waypoints)
- **Local Planner**: Low-level path planning that determines *how* to get there (collision-free paths)

The system operates in a **reactive loop**:
1. Receive perception data (`/fused_buoys`) and odometry (`/odom`)
2. Update internal world model (EntityList)
3. Run task-specific logic to generate goals
4. Use potential fields planner to compute collision-free path to goals
5. Convert path to velocity commands for MAVROS
6. Publish commands and repeat at 10 Hz

## Global Planner Node (ROS Integration)

**File**: `Global_Planner/global_planner/global_planner_node.py`

### Purpose
The ROS 2 node that bridges the ROS ecosystem with the planning library. It handles all ROS communication and orchestrates the planning loop.

### Subscriptions

1. **`/fused_buoys`** (FusedBuoyArray)
   - Input from CV-LiDAR fusion
   - Contains detected buoys with positions, IDs, and class IDs
   - Updates EntityList every time new detections arrive

2. **`/odom`** (nav_msgs/Odometry)
   - Boat position (x, y) and heading from MAVROS/Pixhawk
   - Used for:
     - Current pose in planning
     - Start position initialization (first odom message)
     - Velocity for collision detection (watchdogs)

3. **`/mavros/state`** (mavros_msgs/State, optional)
   - Pixhawk flight mode
   - Planning only runs when `mode == "GUIDED"`
   - If MAVROS not available, planning always runs (with warning)

4. **`/mavros/global_position/global`** (sensor_msgs/NavSatFix)
   - GPS coordinates for Task 2 debris reporting
   - Used to convert odom positions to lat/lon

### Publications

1. **`/planned_path`** (nav_msgs/Path)
   - Next waypoint/goal position
   - Published when goals exist
   - Frame: `odom` (or from odom header)

2. **`/mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped`** (geometry_msgs/Twist)
   - Velocity commands in **body frame** (forward, left, up)
   - Converted from planner's world-frame velocities
   - Zero velocity if:
     - Not in GUIDED mode
     - No start position set
     - Watchdog override active
     - No goals/velocity from planner

3. **`/gs_message_send`** (std_msgs/String)
   - Task 2: Debris/indicator lat/lon reports (throttled every 2 seconds)
   - Task 3: Indicator color reports (throttled every 2 seconds)

### Planning Loop (10 Hz)

Every 0.1 seconds, the node:

1. **Checks GUIDED mode**: If not GUIDED, publish zero velocity and return
2. **Checks start position**: If not set, publish zero velocity and return
3. **Runs TaskMaster**: Calls `run_one_shot()` with current pose and detections
4. **Applies watchdogs**: Checks for collisions, stuck conditions, etc.
5. **Publishes results**: Path waypoint and velocity commands

### Key Functions

- **`_fused_callback()`**: Updates EntityList from `/fused_buoys`
- **`_odom_callback()`**: Updates pose, sets start position on first message
- **`_planning_tick()`**: Main planning loop (10 Hz timer callback)
- **`_odom_to_latlon()`**: Converts odom (m) to GPS (lat/lon) for Task 2 reports

---

## TaskMaster (Orchestrator)

**File**: `TaskMaster.py`

### Purpose
Central orchestrator that manages task lifecycle and coordinates between task managers and the local planner.

### Initialization

```python
TaskMaster(entities, start, task_id, map_bounds)
```

- **entities**: EntityList instance (shared world model)
- **start**: Starting position (x, y) in meters
- **task_id**: 1, 2, or 3 (determines which TaskManager to create)
- **map_bounds**: Optional (max_x, max_y) for arena boundaries

Creates:
- Appropriate TaskManager (Task1Manager, Task2Manager, or Task3Manager)
- PotentialFieldsPlanner instance

### Main Function: `run_one_shot()`

Called every planning tick (10 Hz) by the ROS node.

**Inputs**:
- `get_pose`: Function returning current (x, y, heading)
- `get_detections`: Function returning list of DetectedEntity
- `use_planning`: Whether to run local planner (default True)
- `map_bounds`: Optional map bounds update

**Process**:
1. Update task manager's pose from `get_pose()`
2. Add new detections to task manager
3. Call `manager.tick()` - updates goals based on task logic
4. Call `manager.plan(planner)` - computes path using potential fields
5. Return status, path, velocities, speeds

**Outputs**:
- `status`: "RUNNING" or "SUCCESS"
- `path`: List of waypoints [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]
- `velocities`: Velocity vectors for each path point
- `speeds`: Speed magnitudes for each path point
- `phase`: Current phase (for Task 2/3)

---

## EntityList (Data Management)

**File**: `Global/entities.py`

### Purpose
Centralized world model that stores all detected entities (buoys, indicators, goals) and provides query methods for tasks.

### Entity Types

Mapped from class IDs (from CV-LiDAR fusion):
- `black_buoy`: Debris (class 0, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22)
- `green_buoy`: Gate marker (class 1, 2)
- `red_buoy`: Gate marker (class 3, 4)
- `yellow_buoy`: Task 3 target (class 5)
- `red_indicator`: Task 2/3 indicator (class 9)
- `green_indicator`: Task 2/3 indicator (class 10)
- `goal`: Waypoints created by tasks (not from perception)

### Key Methods

#### `apply_tracked_buoys(entity_list, buoys, tolerance)`
Called by ROS node when `/fused_buoys` arrives.

**Process**:
1. For each buoy in message:
   - Extract position (x, y), ID, class_id (or color)
   - Map class_id to entity_type
   - Add or update entity in list (same ID = same entity)
2. Detect new red-green gate pairs
3. When new pair detected:
   - Push current entity IDs to "cohort" queue
   - If queue > 2 cohorts, prune oldest (removes old obstacles)

**Cohort System**: Prevents memory growth by dropping entities from gates that were passed long ago.

#### `get_gates(max_gate_width=15.0)`
Returns list of `(red_pos, green_pos)` gate pairs.

**Pairing Logic**:
- For each red buoy, find nearest green buoy within `max_gate_width`
- Filters: max Y difference (5 m), min X separation (2 m)
- Returns sorted pairs

#### `get_obstacles()`
Returns positions of all obstacle entities (everything except goals and start).

Used by:
- Local planner (potential fields repulsion)
- Watchdogs (collision detection)
- Goal nudging (avoid placing goals on obstacles)

#### `get_no_go_obstacle_points(map_bounds)`
Returns sampled points along gate "walls" (no-go zones).

**Process**:
- For each gate, creates left/right wall segments extending 15 m along gate normal
- Samples points every 1 m along walls
- If `map_bounds` provided, adds boundary points (arena walls)

#### `get_goals()`
Returns positions of all `goal` entities (waypoints created by tasks).

#### `get_black_buoys()`
Returns `(entity_id, position)` for all black buoys (Task 2 debris reporting).

## Task 1: Two Gates

**File**: `Global/Task1.py`

### Objective
Navigate through two gates in order, completing the mission when both gates are crossed.

### State Management

- **`goal_plan`**: List of GoalPlan objects (one per gate)
  - Each has: `goal_id`, `position`, `completed` flag
- **`locked_gates`**: Once 2 gates detected, locks them (prevents reordering)
- **`next_gate_index`**: Index of current active gate
- **`last_gate_normal`**: Direction vector for fallback (perpendicular to gate)

### Execution Flow

#### Phase 1: Gate Discovery and Locking

**`_lock_gates_once()`**:
- Waits until 2 gates detected
- Computes gate centers: `((red_x + green_x)/2, (red_y + green_y)/2)`
- Orders gates by projection onto forward direction:
  - Forward direction = boat heading (if available) OR start → nearest gate
- Creates GoalPlan for each gate center
- Locks gates (prevents changes)

#### Phase 2: Goal Publishing

**`publish_goals()`**:
- Clears old goals from EntityList
- Finds first incomplete goal in `goal_plan`
- Nudges goal away from obstacles (using `goal_utils.nudge_goal_away_from_obstacles`)
- Publishes as `goal_wp1` to EntityList
- Only publishes **one goal at a time** (next gate)

#### Phase 3: Gate Crossing Detection

**`_check_goal_completion()`**:
- Checks if boat motion segment (prev_pos → current_pos) intersects gate segment (red → green)
- Uses `goal_utils.segments_intersect()` for intersection test
- When gate crossed: marks corresponding GoalPlan as completed, increments `next_gate_index`

#### Phase 4: Fallback (No Gates Detected)

**`_fallback_goal()`**:
- If gates not locked yet:
  - Uses `last_gate_normal` (perpendicular to last seen gate) OR boat heading
  - Creates waypoint 100 m ahead along that direction
  - Clips to map_bounds if provided
  - Nudges away from obstacles

### Completion

**`done()`**: Returns `True` when all goals in `goal_plan` are completed.

### Planning

**`plan(planner, max_goals=1)`**:
- Gets current active goal from `goal_queue`
- Calls `planner.plan_multi_goal_path()` with:
  - Start: current pose
  - Goals: [next goal]
  - Obstacles: buoys + no-go points
  - Gates: locked gates (for gate alignment)
- Stores path, velocities, speeds in manager

## Task 2: Debris Clearance

**File**: `Global/Task2.py`

### Objective
Three-phase mission:
1. **TRANSIT_OUT**: Navigate through channel gates (outbound)
2. **DEBRIS_FIELD**: Find survivors (green indicators), circle them, avoid hazards
3. **RETURN**: Navigate back through channel to start

### State Management

- **`phase`**: TRANSIT_OUT, DEBRIS_FIELD, or RETURN
- **`report`**: In-memory storage of detected debris/indicators (for reporting)
- **`channel_centers_out`**: Gate centers saved during TRANSIT_OUT (for RETURN)
- **`handled_survivors`**: Set of survivor IDs already circled
- **`current_survivor_plan`**: 4-point circle plan for current survivor
- **`goal_reached_dist`**: Distance threshold (2 m) for goal completion

### Execution Flow

#### Phase A: TRANSIT_OUT

**`_lock_channel_centers()`**:
- Waits until 2+ gates detected
- Computes gate centers, sorts by Y (northbound)
- Saves centers to `channel_centers_out`
- Creates GoalPlan for each center (nudged away from obstacles)

**Goal Completion**:
- Checks distance to current goal
- If within `goal_reached_dist` (2 m), marks complete

**Transition to DEBRIS_FIELD**:
- When all channel goals completed → switch to DEBRIS_FIELD phase

**Fallback**:
- If no gates detected: forward waypoint 50 m along gate normal (same as Task 1 fallback)

#### Phase B: DEBRIS_FIELD

**Survivor Detection**:
- Looks for `green_indicator` entities
- For each unhandled survivor:
  - Creates 4-point circle plan around survivor (6 m radius)
  - Each point nudged away from obstacles
  - Stores in `current_survivor_plan`

**Goal Publishing**:
- If survivor circle active: publishes circle waypoints one at a time
- If no survivor seen: forward waypoint (same as fallback)

**Survivor Completion**:
- When all 4 circle points completed:
  - If more survivors: start next survivor circle
  - If no more survivors: transition to RETURN

**Reporting**:
- All detections added to `report` (green/red indicators, black buoys)
- ROS node publishes lat/lon reports to `/gs_message_send` (throttled)

#### Phase C: RETURN

**`_create_return_plan()`**:
- Reverses `channel_centers_out` list
- Creates GoalPlan for each waypoint (back through channel)
- Nudges away from obstacles

**Goal Publishing**:
- Publishes return waypoints one at a time

**Completion**:
- When all return goals completed → `mission_complete = True`

### Completion

**`done()`**: Returns `True` when `mission_complete` is True.

### Planning

**`plan(planner, max_goals=2)`**:
- Plans to next 2 goals (for smoother multi-waypoint paths)
- Uses same planner interface as Task 1

---

## Task 3: Speed Challenge

**File**: `Global/Task3.py`

### Objective
Fast completion:
1. Enter through gate (red + green buoys)
2. Detect indicator color (red = CCW, green = CW)
3. Circle yellow buoy in indicated direction
4. Exit through same gate

### State Management

- **`phase`**: ENTRY, SEARCH_YELLOW, LOOP_AROUND, EXIT
- **`entrance_gate`**: Gate pair (red, green) - locked once detected
- **`gate_center`**: Center of entrance gate (for entry/exit)
- **`entry_crossed`**: Boolean flag (gate crossing detected)
- **`exit_crossed`**: Boolean flag (gate crossing detected)
- **`indicator_color`**: "red" or "green" (set once, never changes)
- **`yellow_pos`**: Position of yellow buoy (when detected)
- **`loop_goal`**: Locked tangential waypoint around yellow (prevents flicker)
- **`start_time`**: Timestamp when entry gate crossed
- **`finish_time`**: Timestamp when exit gate crossed

### Execution Flow

#### Phase: ENTRY

**`_ensure_gate()`**:
- Waits for first gate pair
- Stores as `entrance_gate` and computes `gate_center`

**Goal Publishing**:
- Publishes `gate_center` as goal

**Gate Crossing**:
- `_check_gate_cross()` detects segment intersection
- When crossed: sets `entry_crossed = True`, starts timer (`start_time`)

**Transition**:
- When `entry_crossed` → switch to SEARCH_YELLOW phase

#### Phase: SEARCH_YELLOW

**Indicator Detection**:
- When `red_indicator` or `green_indicator` detected → sets `indicator_color`
- Never re-detects (locked once seen)

**Goal Publishing**:
- Bias waypoint based on indicator:
  - Red indicator → right side (CCW preparation)
  - Green indicator → left side (CW preparation)
- Waypoint: 25 m forward + 25 m to side

**Yellow Detection**:
- When `yellow_buoy` detected → stores `yellow_pos`

**Transition**:
- When both `yellow_pos` and `indicator_color` set → switch to LOOP_AROUND

#### Phase: LOOP_AROUND

**Locked Loop Goal**:
- **`_compute_locked_loop_goal()`** computes tangential point around yellow:
  - Vector from yellow to boat
  - Perpendicular vector (tangent direction)
  - Red indicator → CCW tangent (left normal)
  - Green indicator → CW tangent (right normal)
  - Point 20 m beyond yellow along tangent
- **Locked once**: `loop_goal` computed once on phase entry, never recomputed

**Goal Publishing**:
- Publishes `loop_goal` (locked, doesn't move)

**Completion Check**:
- When boat within 4 m of `loop_goal` → switch to EXIT

#### Phase: EXIT

**Goal Publishing**:
- Publishes `gate_center` (same gate as entry)

**Gate Crossing**:
- `_check_gate_cross()` detects exit crossing
- When crossed: sets `exit_crossed = True`, stops timer (`finish_time`)

### Completion

**`done()`**: Returns `True` when `exit_crossed` is True.

### Planning

**`plan(planner)`**:
- Plans to next 2 goals (entry/loop or loop/exit)
- Uses same planner interface

### Reporting

- ROS node publishes indicator color to `/gs_message_send` (throttled)
- Completion time computed: `finish_time - start_time`

## Local Planner: Potential Fields

**File**: `Local/potential_fields_planner.py`

### Purpose
Computes collision-free paths from current position to goals using potential field gradient descent.

### Algorithm Overview

**Potential Field** = Attractive (to goals) + Repulsive (from obstacles)

- **Attractive force**: Pulls toward goal (proportional to distance)
- **Repulsive force**: Pushes away from obstacles (exponential decay with distance)
- **Gate alignment**: When close to gate goal, adds alignment force (biases toward red side)

### Key Parameters

- **`K_ATT`** (1.8): Attractive gain (stronger pull to goals)
- **`K_REP`** (140.0): Repulsive gain (stronger push from obstacles)
- **`D_INFLUENCE`** (10.0 m): Obstacle influence distance
- **`MAX_VELOCITY`** (2.0 m/s): Maximum speed
- **`GOAL_THRESHOLD`** (2.0 m): Consider goal reached
- **`GATE_APPROACH_DIST`** (35.0 m): Start gate alignment when this close

### Path Computation: `gradient_descent_path()`

**Process**:
1. Start at current position
2. For each iteration (max 4000):
   - Compute gradient:
     - Attractive: `K_ATT * (current - goal)`
     - Repulsive: Sum over obstacles within `D_INFLUENCE`
       - Exponential decay: `K_REP * exp(-dist/2) / (2*dist)`
     - Gate alignment (if close to gate goal):
       - Bias toward red side (offset along gate normal)
       - Strength increases as distance decreases
   - Step along negative gradient (toward goal, away from obstacles)
   - Adaptive step size (damped by gradient magnitude)
   - If gradient too small (local minimum):
     - Nudge with random angle spread (toward goal direction)
     - After `MAX_NUDGE_COUNT` (50) nudges → fallback to straight line
   - Add point to path if moved enough (`MIN_POINT_SPACING`)
   - Check goal reached (`GOAL_THRESHOLD`)
3. Return path array

### Path Smoothing: `smooth_path()`

- Moving average filter (window size 5, 2 iterations)
- Reduces jaggedness from gradient descent
- Endpoints (goals) remain fixed

### Velocity Computation: `compute_velocities()`

**Process**:
1. Compute velocity vectors: `(path[i+1] - path[i]) / dt`
2. Smooth velocities (moving average, window 3)
3. Compute speeds: `norm(velocities)`
4. Clip to `MAX_VELOCITY`
5. Return velocities and speeds arrays

### Multi-Goal Planning: `plan_multi_goal_path()`

**Process**:
1. For each goal in sequence:
   - Compute path segment from current position to goal
   - Append to full path (skip duplicate start point)
   - Update current position to goal
2. Smooth entire path
3. Compute velocities for full path
4. Return: path, velocities, speeds, segment_indices

### Gate Alignment

When planning to a gate goal:
- If within `GATE_APPROACH_DIST` (35 m):
  - Computes gate normal (perpendicular to red→green vector)
  - Adds alignment force toward red side (offset `GATE_OFFSET` = 0.8 m)
  - Strength increases as distance decreases
  - Helps boat approach gate from correct side

---

## Watchdogs (Safety Protocols)

**File**: `Global_Planner/global_planner/watchdogs.py`

### Purpose
Safety layer that overrides planner commands when dangerous conditions detected.

### Protocols

#### 1. Stuck Protocol
- **Trigger**: After `MAX_SPIN_SEARCHES` (3) spin+reorient cycles with no goal
- **Action**: Publish zero velocity forever
- **State**: `stuck = True` (never resets)

#### 2. Collision Avoidance
- **Trigger**: Obstacle within `COLLISION_DISTANCE_M` (2.0 m) AND closing speed > 0.1 m/s
- **Action**: Reverse at `REVERSE_SPEED_M_S` (0.5 m/s) for `REVERSE_DISTANCE_M` (1.0 m)
- **State**: `reverse_remaining_m` counts down

#### 3. Prediction Timeout (No Goal)
- **Trigger**: No goal for `PREDICTION_TIMEOUT_SEC` (25 seconds)
- **Action**: Spin at `SPIN_ANGULAR_RATE_RAD_S` (0.5 rad/s) for `SPIN_DURATION_SEC` (20 seconds)
- **State**: `spin_until_time` tracks spin end time

#### 4. Reorient After Spin
- **Trigger**: After spin completes
- **Action**: Rotate back to `original_heading` at `REORIENT_RATE_RAD_S` (0.4 rad/s)
- **State**: `reorient_until_time` tracks reorient end
- **Completion**: When heading error < `REORIENT_DONE_THRESHOLD_RAD` (0.1 rad)

#### 5. Reset on Goal
- **Trigger**: When goal appears
- **Action**: Resets all prediction/spin/reorient state
- **State**: Clears timeouts, resets counters

### Execution Flow

**`tick(state, time_now, dt_sec, pose, velocity, obstacles, has_goal)`**:

1. **Check stuck**: If stuck → return zero velocity
2. **Check collision**: If obstacle close and closing → start reverse
3. **Check reversing**: If reversing → continue reverse, decrement remaining
4. **Check has goal**: If goal exists → reset prediction state, return None (no override)
5. **Check prediction start**: If no prediction started → start timer
6. **Check spin phase**: If spinning → continue spin
7. **Check spin complete**: If spin just finished → start reorient
8. **Check reorient phase**: If reorienting → rotate toward original heading
9. **Check prediction timeout**: If timeout exceeded → start spin
10. **Return None**: No override needed

### State Dictionary

```python
{
    "stuck": bool,
    "reverse_remaining_m": float,
    "spin_until_time": float | None,
    "reorient_until_time": float | None,
    "reorient_target_heading": float | None,
    "prediction_start_time": float | None,
    "original_heading": float,
    "spin_search_count": int,
}
```

### Integration

Called every planning tick by `global_planner_node._planning_tick()`:
- If watchdog returns override → publish override velocity, skip planner
- Otherwise → use planner output

### Coordinate Frames

- **World Frame (odom)**: East-North-Up (ENU)
  - Used by: EntityList positions, planner paths, odometry
- **Body Frame (base_link)**: Forward-Left-Up (FLU)
  - Used by: MAVROS velocity commands
  - Conversion: Rotate world-frame velocity by boat heading

### Goal Lifecycle

1. **Detection**: Buoys detected → added to EntityList
2. **Task Logic**: Task manager generates goals based on task rules
3. **Nudging**: Goals nudged away from obstacles (if too close)
4. **Publishing**: Goals added to EntityList as `goal` entities
5. **Planning**: Local planner computes path to goals
6. **Execution**: Velocity commands sent to MAVROS
7. **Completion**: Task checks if goal reached (distance or gate crossing)
8. **Cleanup**: Completed goals removed from active list

### Entity Lifecycle

1. **Perception**: CV-LiDAR fusion publishes `/fused_buoys`
2. **Update**: `apply_tracked_buoys()` adds/updates entities
3. **Cohort Management**: New gate pairs trigger cohort creation
4. **Pruning**: Old cohorts pruned when > 2 cohorts exist
5. **Query**: Tasks query EntityList for gates, obstacles, goals
6. **Cleanup**: Pruned entities removed from list

## Summary

The planning system is a **reactive, hierarchical architecture**:

- **Global Planner Node**: ROS integration, data flow, safety
- **TaskMaster**: Orchestrates task execution
- **Task Managers**: Task-specific goal generation (Task 1/2/3)
- **EntityList**: Centralized world model
- **Potential Fields Planner**: Collision-free path computation
- **Watchdogs**: Safety overrides

The system runs at **10 Hz**, continuously:
1. Updating world model from perception
2. Generating goals based on task logic
3. Computing collision-free paths
4. Publishing velocity commands
5. Monitoring safety conditions

Each component is **ROS-free** (except the node), making the planning library reusable and testable independently of ROS.
